# Naive Bayes Classifier - Detailed Project Overview

## Project Description
This project implements a Naive Bayes Classifier using `MultinomialNB` from `scikit-learn` to classify data based on a given dataset. The classifier is trained, evaluated, and its performance metrics are calculated and displayed, including accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib` (for visualization, if needed)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/naive-bayes-classifier.git
   cd naive-bayes-classifier
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Preprocessing
### Steps Involved:
1. **Loading the Data**: The data is loaded from a source (file, database, or generated data).
2. **Cleaning the Data**: Ensure that the data is free of NaN values or outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract or generate features that are suitable for the `MultinomialNB` classifier.
4. **Normalizing Data**: Since `MultinomialNB` cannot handle negative values, ensure all feature values are non-negative. This is done using `MinMaxScaler`.

### Example Preprocessing Code:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

## Model Training
1. **Initialize the Classifier**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
   naive_bayes_classifier = MultinomialNB()
   ```

2. **Train the Model**:
   ```python
   naive_bayes_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

3. **Make Predictions**:
   ```python
   y_pred = naive_bayes_classifier.predict(X_test)
   ```

## Evaluation
To assess the performance of the Naive Bayes model, the following metrics are used:
1. **Accuracy**: Measures the overall effectiveness of the classifier.
2. **Classification Report**: Provides a detailed breakdown of precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes the performance of the model in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

### Example Evaluation Code:
```python
from sklearn import metrics

print("Accuracy:", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(metrics.classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", metrics.confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
```

## Results
The results of the Naive Bayes Classifier are displayed as:
- **Accuracy Score**: A numerical representation of the accuracy.
- **Classification Report**: A summary of precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix showing the distribution of predictions.

## Usage
1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook project.ipynb
   ```
2. **Follow the steps in the notebook to execute the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation**.
